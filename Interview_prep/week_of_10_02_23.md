## Two Pointers

-- The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, itâ€™s in an array, in a linked list, or in a string of characters.
-- The input data is sorted, or else, arranged in a way that is relevant to the problem, such as numeric data sorted in ascending or descending order, or characters arranged symmetrically.
-- We limit our focus to a specific range of elements within the input data, as dictated by the positions of the two pointers, allowing us to consider a small subset of elements rather than the entire set.
