Persian new year.

# March 22, 2023 

Stuck on a new bug.
Satrted [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/) until I'm able to get some help with the bug.

# March 23, 2023 

A few more lessons in Comprehensive Rust.

Got my very experienved dev friend to try and solve the bug...he couldn't, contemplating what to do next about this project. My friend, ChatGPT, and a ton of internet searches have lead nowhere, and the book does not have any guidance on what to do when stuck on something like this.
